        Hello! My name is Manisha Nallakatla and I am a Computer Science major and Data Science minor at the University of North Carolina
        at Chapel Hill. When I was younger, I really enjoyed painting, drawing, braiding hair, and pretty much anything else that required
        me to be creative. One of my favorite movies growing up was Iron Man, and I was enamored by the idea of honing my creative
        skills to create something with technology! Thus, my love for coding was born...
